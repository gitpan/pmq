pmq version 0.1.2

Report the installed version of a Perl module, or list all modules
with their versions.  Examples:

% pmq Date::Manip
% pmq --all

This is intended as an answer to the two FAQs, 'how do I find out what
version of a module is installed?' and 'how do I list all modules
installed on a system?'.  It's quite handy for upgrading a whole perl
installation from one release to another, since you can take before
and after snapshots and check nothing has broken or been downgraded.

* Changes since the last release

Corrected some misleading documentation.  All of pmq's methods for
finding a module's version number involve executing some code from
that module.

* Installation

As for Perl modules.

% perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/usr/local
(or change /usr/local to your chosen location)
% make
(there is no 'make test' for this program)
% make install

* Copying

This program is in the public domain, which means there are no
copyright restrictions and you can do what you want with it.  Contact:

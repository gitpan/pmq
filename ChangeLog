	* Makefile.PL, README, pmq: Version 0.1.3.

2002-11-15 14:40  ed

	* pmq: Added a new option inspired by Matthew O. Persico's
	perl_version: the -f or --with-filename flag prints the filename of
	the .pm file after the version number.

2002-11-15 14:38  ed

	* pmq: Oops, due to XEmacs typing weirdness some text ended up in
	the wrong place.

2002-11-15 14:22  ed

	* pmq: Added some hidden pod documentation to conform to the CPAN
	script guidelines at
	<http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/scripts/submitting.html>.  Not that
	pmq can be uploaded as a CPAN script, since it isn't distributed as
	a single file, but anyway.

	* Makefile.PL, README, pmq: Version 0.1.2.

2002-10-29 11:38  ed

	* pmq: It turns out that ExtUtils::MM_Unix's parse_version() method
	does not parse at all, but evalates the version-setting line.  This
	means that the command line and documentation of pmq is misleading.
	 I've renamed the method 'parse' to 'eval'.

2002-10-28 17:40  ed

	* README: Updated with release notes for 0.1.1.

2002-10-28 17:37  ed

	* MANIFEST, MANIFEST.SKIP, Makefile.PL, README, install, mkdist,
	pmq: Packaged in proper Perl style with a Makefile.PL, pod
	documentation and (for my use) a mkdist script which checks version
	numbers.  Also added --help and --version options.

2002-09-06 22:27  ed

	* mkdist: Adding 'mkdist' script to create a distribution directory
	from the working copy.

2002-09-06 22:12  ed

	* README, install: Added installer (guess_install).

2002-09-06 22:11  ed

	* pmq: Fixed howling bug when looking for a module's filename.	I'm
	amazed I didn't spot this sooner :-(.

2002-09-06 22:02  ed

	* README, pmq: Grabbed the program called 'pmv' from my bin/
	directory, tidied it up and added lots of new features, renamed it
	'pmq' (Perl Module Query, I suppose) and imported into CVS.

	* README, pmq: Initial revision
